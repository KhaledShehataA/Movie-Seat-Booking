Iam going to build this little UI which is something like a movie theater website, where you pick your seats, movie.
I'm gonna save everything in Local Storage and then populate the UI with that data so that when I'm back to the page It's STILL HERE!


## Tech

- Will be working with Local Storage, Some High Order Array Methods(foreach, map...) and Spread Operator.
